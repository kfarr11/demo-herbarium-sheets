# Herbarium Sheets at the College of Wooster 

This collection was created by Mary Ronsheim in 1950, when she was attending the College of Wooster. The collection is comprised of various leaf samples taken from trees on Wooster's campus and in the larger community. Off campus locations include the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC) which was the Wooster Experimental Station at the time of sample collection, the Wooster Fairgrounds, and a set of local ponds known as Miller's Ponds. The samples in this collection range multiple biologic family and genus classifications, which is noted on each sheet. The collection was later given to the College of Wooster's Special Collections department in the Libraries, where it has been preserved and cared for by Denise Monbarren, Special Collections Librarian. 

The sheets included in this digital collection are part of a larger collection, and have been used as a piloted sample of the collection for the purposes of learning CollectionBuilder at Digital Humanities Summer Institute 2024 (DHSI 2024). The main digital collection lives in the College of Wooster's institutional repository, OpenWorks, and contains over 70 sheets. This CollectionBuilder site and the main collection on OpenWorks were built by Katie Farr, the Institutional Repository Specialist at the College of Wooster Libraries.
